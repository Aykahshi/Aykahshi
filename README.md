### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Senior Software Engineer specializing in **Flutter** application development and modern full-stack technologies.
Beyond a solid technical foundation, I excel in **AI-Driven Development**. By deeply integrating advanced AI tools like **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Antigravity**, I significantly boost development efficiency, delivering high-quality, maintainable code in record time.

### 🚀 Current Focus Projects

Currently dedicated to developing and optimizing the following projects, exploring the deep integration of AI Agents with the development ecosystem:

- **[Omo Switch](https://github.com/Aykahshi/omo-switch)**  
  A lightweight tool that simplifies switching between different oh-my-opencode configurations with ease.

- **[Flutter Agent Panel](https://github.com/Aykahshi/flutter-agent-panel)**  
  A modern, cross-platform terminal aggregator designed for the AI era. It unifies professional terminal emulation with seamless AI Agent integration (e.g., Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI), creating a cohesive workspace for developers.

- **[Copilot MCP Tool](https://github.com/Aykahshi/copilot-mcp-tool)**  
  An actively maintained Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges GitHub Copilot CLI with MCP clients. It empowers AI assistants with interactive tools, session management, and dedicated plugins for enhanced context awareness.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Possessing a broad technical horizon, capable of selecting the most appropriate tools based on business needs:

- **Core**: Flutter, Dart, Python, TypeScript
- **Frontend Frameworks**: Vue.js, Angular, React
- **Backend & Database**: PostgreSQL, Node.js
- **AI & Efficiency**: Claude Code, Copilot, Antigravity, Zed

### 🎮 Legacy Side Projects

- **[Auto Nueip](https://github.com/Aykahshi/auto_nueip_revamp)**: An unofficial mobile client for the NUEIP HR system. It serves as a comprehensive **real-world implementation of Joker State**, featuring Clean Architecture, GPS check-ins, and local notifications.

- **[Joker State](https://github.com/Aykahshi/joker_state)**: A lightweight Flutter state management solution I created, focused on minimalist architecture. It powers application like *Auto Nueip* to demonstrate its practical capability.
